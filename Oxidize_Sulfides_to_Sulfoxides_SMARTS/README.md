Reviewers commented that Reaction SMARTS were a better option for operations with SMILES. 

Here is an implementation of using reaction SMARTS to oxidize sulfides to sulfoxides. Reviewers also mentioned that broadly combining carboxylic acids + sulfinates to produce sulfoxides is not necessarily relevant when evaluating meaningful chemical space.
