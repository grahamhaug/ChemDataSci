Python scripts for calculating normalized Principle Moments of Inertia and subsequently plotting them

CalculateNormalizePrincipleMomentsInertia.py
- Calculate first two NPRs for a series of data
- outputs many CSVs which can be combined with csvstitcher.py in /tools (or appended with Pandas)
- Quite time-consuming calculation for larger datasets (better to calculate independently for each set,
  as was done in Calc_Generated_PMI.py for the set of generated sulfoxides)
- Embedding of molecules with RDKit is a potential point of failure - script contains a catch to omit 
  molecules which can't be embedded (these return '-1'). Rare that these occur (~2 out of 10k or so). 

PlotNormalizedPrincipleMomentsInertia.py
- Creates a 3-pointed Linear-Sphere-Disk plot for analysis of molecular shape
