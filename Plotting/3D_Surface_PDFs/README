Python scripts for plotting 3D surface plots of Probability Density Function estimates
- 3D surface plots rendered using matplotlib
- PDF estimated using Gaussian KDE; density can be increased for smoother surfaces (increased time cost)
- Images can be rendered separately for each dataset or in tandem with baseline removed
- Scripts for generating examples of KDE plots are in the /tools directory
