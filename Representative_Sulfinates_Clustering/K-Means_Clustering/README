Python scripts for performing repeated runs of K-Means clustering for selection of 27 representative sulfinates

ClusterValidation_sel27_KMeans_minmaxed.py
- Perform 50 runs of K-Means clustering for 27 sulfinates using normalized scaling
- Report Silhouette scores for each run
- Select the sulfinates closest to the cluster centroids (minimum Euclidean distances)
- Calculate min/max/avg pairwise distances for selected sulfinates
- Plot an image of the clustering (kmeans_n27_minmaxed_sulfinates_15.png)
- Output the selected sulfinates to a csv file (selected_sulfinates_15_minmax.csv)
- Output an image of the selected sulfinates (kmeans_minimax-15.png)
- Output a summary of the clustering performance across repeated runs (KMeans_Sampling_Performance-minimaxed.csv)

ClusterValidation_sel27_KMeans_standardized.py
- Perform 50 runs of K-Means clustering for 27 sulfinates using standard scaler
- Report Silhouette scores for each run
- Select the sulfinates closest to the cluster centroids (minimum Euclidean distances)
- Calculate min/max/avg pairwise distances for selected sulfinates
- Plot an image of the clustering (kmeans_n27_standardized_sulfinates_5.png)
- Output the selected sulfinates to a csv file (selected_sulfinates_5_standardized.csv)
- Output an image of the selected sulfinates (kmeans_standardized-5.png)
- Output a summary of the clustering performance across repeated runs (KMeans_Sampling_Performance-standardized.csv)
