Python scripts for generating sulfoxides from prepared datasets of sulfinates and carboxylic acids

iterative_sulfoxide_maker.py
- Combines prepared sulfinates (selected_sulfinates_15.csv) and prepared acids
  (sampled_acids_Properties.csv)
- Joins the above at "*" joints to produce sulfoxides
- Outputs a csv of generated sulfoxides which serves as input for Calculate_Complexity_Descriptors.py

helper_functions.py
- functions required by iterative_sulfoxide_maker.py for operation
