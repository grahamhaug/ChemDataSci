Python scripts for parsing PubChem data from CSV (PubChem_Sulfinates_InputData.csv)

Parsing_PubChem_Sulfinates.py
- Parses incoming SMILEs data for sulfinate chemical flags
- Removes sulfinates over 1000 MU
- Drops isotopes/multicomponents/metals/known bad FGs/wonky strings
- Replaces sulfinate chemical flags with "*" to designate joints
- Ensures no duplicate SMILEs are present in final set
- outputs a CSV containing processed SMILEs data (Processed_PubChem_Sulfinates.csv)

Functions_for_parsing.py
- Accessory functions read/required by Parsing_PubChem_Sulfinates.py

Calculate_Complexity_Descriptors.py
- Calculates MW, FSP3, and Cm for a list of SMILEs
- Outputs a csv containing the calculated parameters for each SMILE (Processed_PubChem_Sulfinates_Properties.csv) 

Functions_for_PropCalc.py
- Functions read/required by Calculate_Complexity_Descriptors.py
- Requires BotchScore.py (modified from Dr. Forli group's work: https://github.com/forlilab/bottchscore)

Sulfinate data was manually examined and (viets_omits.csv) and bad structures omitted. For other compounds,
this process was automated.
