Python scripts for parsing PubChem data from CSV (PubChem_Sulfoxides_InputData.csv)

Parsing_PubChem_CAs.py
- Parses incoming SMILEs data for Carboxylic Acid chemical flags
- Removes CAs over 1000 MU
- Drops isotopes/multicomponents/metals/known bad FGs/wonky strings
- Ensures no duplicate SMILEs are present in final set
- outputs two CSV containing processed SMILEs data:
    MonoSubs_PubChem_acids.csv (containing a single CA)
    MultiSubs_Pubchem_acids.csv (containing fragments with multiple substituted CAs)

Functions_for_parsing.py
- Accessory functions read/required by Parsing_PubChem_CAs.py
- Ensures that only Carboxylic Acids are substituted (No esters)
- For each carboxylic acid, determine which atom the CA is bound to
- Check that the bound atom is a Carbon
- Check that the bound Carbon is SP3 hybridized (saturated)
- Only replaces CAs that are bound to SP3 carbons

Calculate_Complexity_Descriptors.py
- Calculates MW, FSP3, and Cm for a list of SMILEs
- Outputs a csv containing the calculated parameters for each SMILE (Processed_PubChem_Sulfoxides_Properties.csv) 

Functions_for_PropCalc.py
- Functions read/required by Calculate_Complexity_Descriptors.py
- Requires BotchScore.py (modified from Dr. Forli group's work: https://github.com/forlilab/bottchscore)

Only MonoSubstituted carboxylic acids were utilized for the generation of sulfoxides.
